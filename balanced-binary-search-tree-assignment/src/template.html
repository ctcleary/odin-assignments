        <h1>The Odin Project - Balanced Binary Search Tree Assignment</h1>
        <p>All the magic is in the console.</p>
        <p>Create a new balanced BST with:</p>
        <pre>new Tree([number, number, .... ])</pre>
        <p>And see the result printed in the console. Which will also show the "pretty printed" results of:</p>
        <pre>new Tree([1, 7, 4, 23, 8, 9, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 67, 6345, 324])</pre>
        <p>The numbers will be sorted, and duplicates removed (as per the assignment spec).</p>
